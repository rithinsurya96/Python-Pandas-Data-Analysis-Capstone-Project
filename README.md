# Python-Pandas-Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project
This capstone project was undertaken to demonstrate proficiency in the end-to-end data science workflow, focusing heavily on data cleaning, transformation, and analytical manipulation using core Python libraries (specifically Pandas).

## 1. Overview
This capstone project was undertaken to demonstrate proficiency in the end-to-end data science workflow, focusing heavily on data cleaning, transformation, and analytical manipulation using core Python libraries. The primary objective was to successfully integrate, clean, and analyze a large-scale (100K+ record) dataset to derive specific, actionable insights relevant for business decision-making.

## 2. Key Features and Technical Execution
This project successfully tackled common real-world data challenges through the following actions:

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
Large-Scale Data Handling: Processed and prepped a raw dataset containing over 100,000 records, ensuring efficiency and scalability.

### Intelligent Imputation
Addressed significant missing data challenges by implementing a method to calculate and apply a running average for imputation, improving data quality and integrity.

### Complex Data Integration
Successfully merged three disparate data frames using various join types to create a unified and comprehensive master dataset.

### Feature Engineering:
Split a composite name column into separate first/last name fields.
Applied conditional logic (using Pandas’ loc and apply methods) to standardize employee titles and determine promotion eligibility based on tenure and performance criteria.

### Data Aggregation & Analysis
Cost Analysis: Calculated and aggregated detailed project costs per employee across the organization using advanced chaining with Pandas’ groupby() and aggregation functions (sum, mean, etc.).

### Targeted Extraction
Filtered and extracted granular employee details based on complex, specific business criteria from the final integrated dataset, demonstrating proficiency in targeted data retrieval.

## 3. Technologies Used
### Language 
Python- Core programming language for the entire project.
### Data Manipulation 
Pandas-Essential library used for all data cleaning, transformation, merging, and aggregation tasks.
### Numerical Operations
NumPy-Used internally by Pandas for efficient array operations (implicit).

## 4. Conclusion
All ten original project tasks were executed successfully, demonstrating a strong command of the Python/Pandas ecosystem. This project serves as conclusive proof of my ability to approach ambiguous, messy, and large-scale data, transform it into a clean, unified structure, and extract the necessary key insights required to support strategic business decisions.
